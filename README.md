# prework-study-guide


## Description

The prework-study-guide is created to assist new students in the U of M full stack bootcamp with referring to one source for helpful pointers on types of software and coding language.

My motivation was to be thorough with the detailed requirements and to produce a website that can be useful for beginners like myself.

This project was designed to give beginners an idea of utilitzing GitHub repositories and coding Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It provides guidance for each type of code in one source.

I gained a better understanding of coding Git in the command line and pushing features/branches to GitHub Repositories. Once in the Repo, I was able to view changes, create pull requests, and merge the changes into the main branch. In addition, I have gained a basic foundation for coding HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
